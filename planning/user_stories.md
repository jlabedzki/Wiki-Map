# Wiki Map User Stories

<--- Three tiers of users (related to maps); 1. not logged in, 2. logged in, 3. creator ---->

As a user, I should be able to see a list of maps created by other people because I’m curious about other people’s local insights/things to do.

As a user, I should be able to view an individual map because I like to know the details and the pins placed on the map.

As a user, I should be able to place multiple pins on a map because there is usually more than one good restaurant/hiking trail/movie theatre.

As a logged in user, the pins I place should be able to have a title, description, and image because I want my pins to be clear to other users.

As a logged in user, I should be able to create a map because I want to share my own local insights with other people.

As a logged in user, I should be able to modify my map because sometimes people change, businesses close/ trails close due to covid, etc.

As a user, I should be able to favourite a map because I want to organize my maps and have easy access to ones I like.

As a user I should be able to have a profile that displays the maps I’ve favorited and the maps I’ve created as well as my profile picture, username, email etc...
